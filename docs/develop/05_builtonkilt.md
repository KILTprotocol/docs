This section contains a non-exhaustive list of apps, wallets and websites that are built on KILT.
If you are not on the list and want to be added, you are welcome to [open a PR](https://github.com/KILTprotocol/docs/edit/master/docs/develop/05_builtonkilt.md).

## Wallets

Wallets are the gateway to Web3.
They store private information like secret keys for KILT DIDs and credentials.
Each time a website needs to access some information about the visitor, the wallet first asks its ownerâ€™s permission to share the requested information.

    Sporran is the first wallet to support the KILT protocol.
    It is maintained by _BOTLabs Trusted Entity B.T.E GmbH_ and it is [open source](https://github.com/BTE-Trusted-Entity/sporran-extension).

## Web Apps

Decentralized applications have already been built that use the functions of the wallet.
