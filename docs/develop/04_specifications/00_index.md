List of core specifications KILT has defined in an effort to standardize APIs and data structures across applications:

- [KILT DID Method (GitHub repo)][kilt-did-method]
- [KiltPublishedCredentialCollectionV1 Service Type (GitHub repo)][kilt-published-credential-collection-v1]
- [KILT Wallet Credential API (GitHub repo)][kilt-wallet-credential-api]
- [KILT Wallet DIDSign API (GitHub repo)][kilt-wallet-didsign-api]

List of extensions to the core KILT protocol that standardize communication with the core KILT components (e.g., API for wallets to present credentials):

- [Wallet Credential API (GitHub repo)][kilt-wallet-credential-api]
- [Wallet DIDSign API (GitHub repo)][kilt-wallet-didsign-api]
