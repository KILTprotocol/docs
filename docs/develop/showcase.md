An incomplete list of apps, wallets and websites that built on KILT.
If you are missing from the list and want to be added, you are welcome to open a PR.


## Wallets

Wallets are like the swiss army knife of the web3.
Your wallet will store private information like your secret for your DID or your KILT credentials.
Each time a website wants to know something about you, the wallet will ask for your permission to share or sign information.
