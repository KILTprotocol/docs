In this section, your <span className="label-role attester">Attester</span> will receive and process a `Credential` where you'll

- Attest or deny it;
- Store the attestation on the chain (more specifically only its hash, we'll get to that);

## Attest a Credential

The `attestCredential` function first initialized all libraries, as always.
After that we can load the account and DID of the <span className="label-role attester">Attester</span>.
When everything is prepared, we can issue an attestation for the credential we received from the <span className="label-role claimer">Claimer</span>.
The attestation becomes valid once it is submitted to the chain.

<CodeBlock className="language-ts" title="attester/attestCredential.ts">
  {AttestCredential}
</CodeBlock>

The function `attestingFlow` shows the process from the beginning to the end.
First the <span className="label-role claimer">Claimer</span> generates the credential and sends it to the <span className="label-role attester">Attester</span>.
After that the <span className="label-role attester">Attester</span> checks the attributes and either attests or denies the attestation because the attributes are invalid.
Once the attestation is written on the chain, the <span className="label-role claimer">Claimer</span> can share all or part of the attested Credentials with verifiers.

## Run

Run it from command line:

```bash
yarn ts-node attester/attestCredential.ts
```

You can copy the `Credential` object if you want to test with other `Verifiers` in the workshop :-)

Your job as an <span className="label-role attester">Attester</span> is done: you've successfully attested a credential and written the attestation hash onto the chain.

Let's move on to setup our <span className="label-role verifier">Verifier</span>!
