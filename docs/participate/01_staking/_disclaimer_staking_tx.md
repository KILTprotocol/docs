You can either execute this transaction in Polkadot JS Apps or the [**KILT Stakeboard**](../../develop/05_builtonkilt.md#web-apps), which serves as an in-house developed Frontend for all KILT staking activity.
Below, we explain how to do it for the former case.
However, the latter option is described in detail in the [**BOTLabs Trusted Entity support hub**](https://support.kilt.io/support/solutions/80000442174).
:::

 In Polkadot JS ([wss://spiritnet.kilt.io](https://polkadot.js.org/apps/?rpc=wss%3A%2F%2Fkilt-rpc.dwellir.com#/explorer), or [wss://peregrine.kilt.io/parachain-public-ws](https://polkadot.js.org/apps/?rpc=wss%3A%2F%2Fperegrine-stg.kilt.io%2Fpara-public-ws#/explorer)) go to `Developer -> Extrinsics -> Submission`.
