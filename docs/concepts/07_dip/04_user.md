A DID key needs to generate a DIP signature for the parent relaychain to 
mark it as â€¦

There are two tools to help you do this: Using the DIP SDK function or the KILT DID utils library.


 The following env variables are required:

 - `RELAY_WS_ADDRESS`: The endpoint address of the relaychain.
 - `PROVIDER_WS_ADDRESS`: The endpoint address of the DIP provider chain.
 - `SUBMITTER_ADDRESS`: The address (encoded with the target chain network prefix `38`) that is authorized to submit the transaction on the target chain.
 - `ENCODED_CALL` / `signer`: The HEX-encoded call to DID-sign.
 - `DID_URI` / `didUri`: The URI of the DID authorizing the operation
 - `VERIFICATION_METHOD` / `keyIds`: The verification method of the DID key to use. Because this script is not able to automatically derive the DID key required to sign the call on the target chain, it has to be explicitely set with this variable. Example values are `authentication`, `assertionMethod`, and `capabilityDelegation`.




### Using the DIP SDK


### Using the KILT DID utils library



This script signs any valid HEX-encoded call of the parent relaychain with the right key re-generated from the provided seedling information, i.e., either with the provided mnemonic, or with the provided combination of base mnemonic and derivation path.

 Valid HEX-encoded calls can be generated by interacting with [PolkadotJS Apps][polkadot-apps] under the `Developer > Extrinsics` menu.
 Once the right call (i.e., the right pallet and right method) with the right parameters has been specified, the HEX-encoded value under `encoded call data` can be copied and passed as parameter to this script.

 - `SUBMITTER_ADDRESS`: The address (encoded with the target chain network prefix `38`) that is authorized to submit the transaction on the target chain.
 - `ENCODED_CALL`: The HEX-encoded call to DID-sign.
 - `DID_URI`: did:kilt:4oHaW2GpZzPH2pspkgUjiJK577ndzW3KcbohdtexE7kQ94RY
