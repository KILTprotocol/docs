The Decentralized Identity Provider (DIP) enables cross-chain decentralized identity system that mirrors the functionality of OpenID.
This means that parachains requiring an identity solution donâ€™t need to build their own infrastructure.
Instead, they can leverage the infrastructure DIP provides.
DIP is open-source, and you can integrate it with existing Polkadot-compatible runtimes with minimal changes and without affecting the fee model of the relying party.

DIP has three key roles: the identity **provider**, the **consumer**, and the **user**.

- The identity **provider** is any blockchain with an identity system that makes it available for other chains, e.g., KILT Protocol, Litentry, etc.
- The relaying party or **consumer** is any blockchain that has chosen to delegate identity management to the provider, thus relieving it of needing to maintain its identity infrastructure.
- The **user** is an entity with an identity on the provider chain and wants to use it on other chains without setting up a new identity on each. A Dapp developer can use the DIP SDK to make this process easier for the user and add other DIP-related features to their app.

## Adding support to a parachain

There are several steps to add DIP support to a Substrate-based parachain, depending on the chain's role.

### Provider chain

1. Find the format of your identity proofs and how verification works with your consumer chains.
2. Add the DIP provider pallet as a dependency in your chain runtime.
3. Configure the DIP provider pallet using the required `Config` trait.

### Consumer chain

1. Agree on the format of your identity proofs and how verification works with your identity provider
2. Add the DIP consumer pallet as a dependency in your chain runtime
3. Configure the DIP consumer pallet using the required `Config` trait.
4. Deploy it on your chain, along with any additional pallets the identity provider requires.

## User accounts

For an account to take advantage of DIP it needs a decentralized identity (DID) and to create a transaction on the provider chain to generate a cross-chain identity commitment.

There are two options for an account to do this:

-   A Dapp developer builds the functionality into their app for a user using the DIP SDK.
-   The user uses the KILT DID utilities library themselves.

## Dapp developer

The DIP SDK is a JavaScript library that makes it easier for Dapp developers to integrate DIP into their apps. The SDK includes methods for interacting with runtimes, generating proofs, and more.
