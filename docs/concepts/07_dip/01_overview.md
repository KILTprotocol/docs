The Decentralized Identity Provider (DIP) enables cross-chain decentralized identity system that mirrors the functionality of OpenID. This means that parachains requiring an identity solution donâ€™t need to build their own infrastructure. Instead, they can leverage the infrastructure DIP provides. DIP is open-source, and you can integrate it with existing Polkadot-compatible runtimes with minimal changes and without affecting the fee model of the relying party.


DIP has three key roles: the identity **provider**, the **consumer**, and the **user**.

- The identity **provider** is any blockchain with an identity system that makes it available for other chains, e.g., KILT Protocol, Litentry, etc.
- The relaying party or **consumer** is any blockchain that has chosen to delegate identity management to the provider, thus relieving it of needing to maintain its identity infrastructure.
- The **user** is an entity with an identity on the provider chain and wants to use it on other chains without setting up a new identity on each.


## Adding support to a parachain

There are several steps to add DIP support to a substrate-based parachain, depending on the chain's role.

### Provider chain


1. Agree on the format of your identity proofs and how verification works with your consumer chains.
2. Add the DIP provider pallet as a dependency in your chain runtime.
3. Configure the DIP provider pallet using the required `Config` trait.

You can find more details in the [Provider pallet](./02_provider.md) section.


### Consumer chain

1. Agree on the format of your identity proofs and how verification works with your identity provider
2. Add the DIP consumer pallet as a dependency in your chain runtime
3. Configure the DIP consumer pallet using the required `Config` trait.
4. Deploy it on your chain, along with any additional pallets the identity provider requires.

You can find more details in the [Consumer pallet](./03_consumer.md) section.
