title: Upgrading to v0.29
---

Version 0.29.0 is the result of our efforts to make the SDK easier to understand and to use.

As a consequence, quite a few things have changed relative to previous versions.
These pages serve as a reference point for what to consider when upgrading to make your transition as smooth as possible.

Find out what has changed and how to upgrade in the [release notes](https://github.com/KILTprotocol/sdk-js/releases/tag/0.29.0).

Also make sure to read up on [how to remain interoperable](./01_backwards_compatibility.md) with previous versions of the SDK.
