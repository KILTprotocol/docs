title: Adjust your delegation stake

A delegator can increase and decrease their stake by calling either  `parachainStaking -> delegatorStakeMore(more)` or `parachainStaking -> delegatorStakeLess(less)`.
Your adjustment becomes effective immediately!
In case you increased your stake, you instantly receive higher rewards for any produced blocks of your collator.
However, if you decreased your delegation amount, the reverse applies and you receive less rewards.

:::caution
You cannot adjust your stake if your collator candidate is in the leaving state, e.g., they want to stop collating.
However, you can still [**revoke**](./04_revoke.md) your delegation or [**exit**](./05_exit.md).
