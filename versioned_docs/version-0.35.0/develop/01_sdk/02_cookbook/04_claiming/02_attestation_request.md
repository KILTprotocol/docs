To obtain credentials, Claimers have to request an attestation for a set of claims from an Attester.
The resulting object is a `Credential`, which can be created following the snippet below.

This process does not involve any interaction with the KILT blockchain, but is simply a communication channel where the Claimer and the Attester can communicate.

<TsJsBlock>
  {RequestAttestation}
</TsJsBlock>

:::note
The structure of the claims must respect the schema defined in the specified CType.
Attesters (and Verifiers) will reject claims that fail to verify correctly.
