The following guide will give you a starting point to begin with KILT.
You will learn how to:

1. Import the **KILT SDK** into a project
2. Connect to the **KILT blockchain**
3. Query a **web3name** to get its **DID**
4. Verify a **credential**, published via a **DID service endpoint**

After completing the quickstart guide, you should have gained a better understanding of KILT through hands-on experience.
The guide requires some experience with javascript and command-line tools.
We will recommend guides to other tutorials to dive deeper into some of the topics.

## Setup

We will focus on creating a new project from scratch, which will require a little setup.
First, we need to create a new project in a new directory.
For this, we run `mkdir kilt-rocks && cd kilt-rocks`.


<Tabs groupId="ts-js-choice">
  <TabItem value='ts' label='Typescript' default>

  From inside the `kilt-rocks` project directory, install the **KILT SDK**, **Ts-node**, **Axios** and **Typescript**:

  ```bash npm2yarn
  npm install @kiltprotocol/sdk-js axios ts-node typescript
  ```

  With all the required dependencies set, just create a new (empty) script file with `touch quickstart.ts`.

  </TabItem>
  <TabItem value='js' label='Javascript'>

  From inside the `kilt-rocks` project directory, install the **KILT SDK**, **Node** and **Axios**:

  ```bash npm2yarn
  npm install @kiltprotocol/sdk-js axios node
  ```

  With all the required dependencies set, just create a new (empty) script file with `touch quickstart.js`.

  </TabItem>
</Tabs>

After you have imported the SDK you will be able to access the functionalities that KILT provides.
Inside the `package.json` add in the value `"type": "module"`.

Let's first declare our `main` function that will execute our script:

<CodeBlock className="language-ts">
  {PrintHelloWorld}
</CodeBlock>

If the setup is correct you can execute the script by calling the name of the file using Node.

<Tabs groupId="ts-js-choice">
  <TabItem value='ts' label='Typescript' default>

  ```bash
  yarn ts-node quickstart.ts
  ```

  </TabItem>
  <TabItem value='js' label='Javascript'>

  ```bash
  node quickstart.js
  ```

  </TabItem>
</Tabs>

As we will extend the code in this file, you can always excute it with the same command.

**Let's get started! ðŸ”¥**

### Import the KILT SDK

Let's begin by importing the **KILT SDK** and **Axios**:

```js
import * as Kilt from '@kiltprotocol/sdk-js'
import axios from 'axios'
```

Now you are able to access the SDK and all its functionality.
We will move onto connecting to the **KILT blockchain**.

### Connect to the KILT Blockchain

Connecting to and disconnecting from the KILT blockchain is required for any operation that relies on the KILT blockchain, such as **querying and verifying a credential**.

Still within the same `main` function, you need to configure the SDK to connect to a **KILT node**.
For this, the SDK exposes **`Kilt.connect()`** to configure the address of the node to connect to.

We will use the official **Spiritnet** address:

<SnippetBlock
  className="language-ts"
>
  {Connect}
</SnippetBlock>

After establishing a connection, you have access to the chain, but let's not forget to **close** any connections when we are done!
Connections to blockchain nodes should be dropped when no longer needed: to do that simply call the `Kilt.disconnect()` function at the bottom of `main` function.

<SnippetBlock
  className="language-ts"
>
  {Disconnect}
</SnippetBlock>

**Congratulations!
You have connected to a Spiritnet node.
Let's now start querying some data from the chain!**

## Query the KILT Blockchain

We will be querying information related to a **web3name** (`john_doe`), and using them to retrieve the **KILT DID** linked to it.
In between the `Kilt.connect()` and `Kilt.disconnect()` lines, add the following code:

<SnippetBlock
  className="language-ts"
  funcEnd="return"
>
  {FetchDid}
</SnippetBlock>

Try executing it and check the result.

Did you get the DID? Nice work! You now have `john_doe`'s DID.
Now let's see if John Doe has any public KILT credentials that we could retrieve and verify!

## Retrieve and Verify a Credential

A **KILT DID** can expose service endpoints, which allow external resources to be linked to the DID.
One type of external resource is represented by, you guessed it, **KILT credentials**!
Therefore, let's see how we can retrieve the **service endpoints** of John Doe's DID and see if they link to any public credentials for us to **query** and **verify**.

We will keep adding code below what we just added.
The code snippet retrieves the service endpoints exposed by the DID we found for `john_doe`:

<SnippetBlock
  className="language-ts"
  funcEnd="return"
>
  {FetchEndpoints}
</SnippetBlock>

If the snippet printed some endpoints, congratulations!
Let's see if we can find a credential among them.

We can select one of the endpoints and query the URL to see if it returns a KILT credentialÂ collection as described in the [KiltPublishedCredentialCollectionV1 specification](https://github.com/KILTprotocol/spec-KiltPublishedCredentialCollectionV1):

<TsJsSnippet funcEnd="return">
  {FetchEndpointData}
</TsJsSnippet>

If the script completes with no errors, it means that we were able to retrieve the published credential using the URL specified in the service endpoint.

We will now have to make sure the credential is **valid** and has a valid **structure**.
To do that, we need to query the credential's `rootHash` from the blockchain to see if it has been **attested** by someone:

<SnippetBlock
  className="language-ts"
  funcEnd="}"
>
  {VerifyAttestation}
</SnippetBlock>

Execute the script and see if you get a valid attestation for John Doe's credential!

If so, it is then time to verify the credential.
This will be indicated by the result of the **verification** process as shown in the snippet below:

<SnippetBlock
  className="language-ts"
>
  {VerifyCredential}
</SnippetBlock>

Now, the last step is to excute the complete script and wait to see whether we can successfully retrieve **and** verify one of John Doe's credentials!

Was it successful? Nice Job!
