The SDK implements the KILT Protocol.
It can be used to manage credentials and DIDs but also provides many more helpers to interact with the KILT Blockchain.

Check out [the Workshop](../workshop/00-welcome.md) for a step-by-step tutorial that introduces the KILT Protocol and teaches how to use the basic features of the SDK.

For a more in-depth explanation of the KILT Protocol have a look at the different topics in the "KILT Core Features" section.
