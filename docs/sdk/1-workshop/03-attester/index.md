In this section you will walk though all processes done by the attester.

1. You will [create an account](./account) that is used to pay for all transactions and pay the deposits for using on chain storage.
2. Next step is to [create a DID](./did) which is the identity that is used to create attestations. While you always can switch the KILT account and pay deposits and fees with any account you like, your DID is the way claimers will identify you and put trust in you.
3. Before we can attest claims, [we need a CTYPE](./ctype) which describes and gives context to what we attest.
4. After we can pay fees and deposits, have an identity and a CTYPE [we can create attestations](./attestation).
