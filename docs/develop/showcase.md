An incomplete list of apps, wallets and websites that built on KILT.
If you are missing from the list and want to be added, you are welcome to open a PR.

<br/>

## Wallets

Wallets are like the swiss army knife of the web3.
Your wallet will store private information like your secret for your DID or your KILT credentials.
Each time a website wants to know something about you, the wallet will ask for your permission to share or sign information.

Sporran is the first wallet with KILT support.
It is maintained by _BOTLabs Trusted Entity B.T.E GmbH_ and the [source code is open source](https://github.com/BTE-Trusted-Entity/sporran-extension).
