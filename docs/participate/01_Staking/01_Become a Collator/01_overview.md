We will guide you through the steps to become a collator.
First, we will discuss the hardware requirements and how you could test the performance of your node.
Then, we go over a few configuration options and show you how to setup and start a KILT collator, including how to generate your sessions keys and join the pool of collator candidates.

In case you are already collating, you could check out the advanced section.
There you will learn how to [**monitor**](../02_Advanced%20Collator%20Section/04_monitoring.md) or [**benchmark**](../02_Advanced%20Collator%20Section/06_benchmarking.md) your node, [**adjust your stake**](../02_Advanced%20Collator%20Section/01_adjust_stake.md), [**fix problems**](../05_troubleshooting.md) or [**leave the network**](../02_Advanced%20Collator%20Section/02_exit.md).
