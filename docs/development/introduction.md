KILT Protocol is flexible, allowing builders and businesses to create use cases for identities and credentials using DIDs, anchoring the hash of the credential onto the blockchain. 

The section covers the KILT Distillery, a cookbook for builders, entrepreneurs, and users.

**WARNING: IF YOU ARE BUILDING ON KILT, REMEMBER TO FOLLOW RUNTIME UPGRADES**

## What is the Distillery?

The KILT Distillery is an on-ramp for people to build any use cases for identities and credentials using DIDs. The Distillery provides tools, the recipes and the magic needed to start projects. It can also be used if you want to adapt existing projects to give them a fresh new Web3 lease of life.

The Distillery provides common workflows as code Recipes, Ingredients, and Tools. The code and ideas here are open concepts to be built upon.
