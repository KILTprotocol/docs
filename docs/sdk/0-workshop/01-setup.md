## Node.js

You need to have [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/) installed. Any stable (LTS) version is sufficient.

## Your working folder

Easy one: create a new folder, named for example `kilt-rocks`. This is where we'll be doing work for the rest of this tutorial.

## KILT-SDK

Navigate into your newly created folder `kilt-rocks`.

Install the KILT-SDK by running the following commands:

```bash
yarn init -y
yarn add @kiltprotocol/sdk-js
```

Or with `npm`:

```bash
npm init -y
npm install @kiltprotocol/sdk-js
```

That's it for the basic setup - We're good to go!
