**Welcome, curious mind!**

In this tutorial, you will:

✔ Get familiar with the essential concepts in KILT: identities, CTYPEs, claims, attested claims and more.

✔ Use the KILT SDK to implement the basic flow of a KILT claim, from creation until verification. You'll create a claim as a <span class="label-role claimer">claimer</span>, attest it as an <span class="label-role attester">attester</span> and verify it as a <span class="label-role verifier">verifier</span>.

✔ Use the KILT SDK to write onto and read from the KILT blockchain.
