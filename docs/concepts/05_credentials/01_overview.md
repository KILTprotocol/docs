**Credentials** consist of a set of claims which belong to a **Claimer**, are attested by an **Attester**, and that a **Verifier** can verify.

To get a credential, a Claimer needs to take the following steps:

1. Find a **CType** to base a claim on. Potential Attesters and Verifiers might advertise this information themselves.
2. Make a **claim** containing a set of properties about themselves.
3. Fulfil any requirement from your Attester. For example, accepting their **Terms** and paying a **Quote**.
4. **Request an attestation** from the Attester.
5. Wait for the Attester to **attest** claims.

Once attested, the wrapped claims are considered to be a valid credential.

To use a Credential, the Claimer can generate a Credential-Presentation for a Verifier.
The verification would follow this process:

1. The Verifier may request a **Credential** of a CType, along with with properties to reveal.
He would also provide a **challenge** to ensure the presentations are not recycled.
2. The Claimer selectively **discloses** the requested properties and signs them along with the challenge to generate a presentation.
3. The Verifier **verify** the presentation structure, content and signature, and decides whether they trust the Attester of the presented credential.

The next sections describe each step in more detail.
