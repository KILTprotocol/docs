title: Overview

This section expands on the [Credential API Specification](https://github.com/KILTprotocol/spec-ext-credential-api) and includes code examples to help you build a decentralized application (dapp).

This documentation assumes that you already have a browser extension capable of exposing the credential API to your dapp.
We suggest using Sporran:

- [Sporran Full Version](https://github.com/BTE-Trusted-Entity/sporran-extension)
- [Sporran Test Version for Peregrine](https://github.com/BTE-Trusted-Entity/sporran-extension/releases)
- [Sporran Lite (Credentials only)](https://github.com/BTE-Trusted-Entity/sporran-extension/tree/sporran-lite)
