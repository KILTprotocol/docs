Here is a glossary of terms related to the KILT Protocol:

KILT Protocol: An open-source blockchain protocol for issuing self-sovereign, and verifiable credentials for Web3, the next generation of the internet. KILT’s mission is to return control over personal data to its owner, restoring privacy to the individual. Developers and entrepreneurs can use KILT’s SDK to quickly spin up applications for issuing, holding and verifying credentials in order to create businesses around identity and privacy.

DID: Stands for Decentralized Identifier, a unique identifier for entities (people, organizations, or things) that is anchored to a blockchain and provides verifiable digital identity. For example, did:kilt:4sxSYXakw1ZXBymzT9t3Yw91mUaqKST5bFUEjGEpvkTuckar. In KILT, identity is built by adding credentials to the DID. A DID can be used for people, machines, services and anything that identities can be built on.

Verifiable Credentials: Digital credentials that contain claims about an entity's identity, qualifications, or other attributes that are cryptographically signed and verifiable.

Attestation: The act of providing evidence or confirming the validity of a claim, typically performed by a trusted third party.

Trust Anchors: Entities that are trusted to issue or verify claims on the KILT network, such as governments, educational institutions, or professional organizations.

Anchor Repository: A decentralized repository where trust anchors can store and manage the public keys used for cryptographic signing and verification of claims.

KILT Coin: The native coin of the KILT Protocol, used for staking and as a means of exchange on the network.

Polkadot: A multi-chain network that allows for interoperability between different blockchain protocols, including the KILT Protocol.

Substrate: A modular blockchain development framework used to build custom blockchain solutions, including the KILT Protocol.

Parachain: A specialized blockchain that runs on top of the Polkadot network and is connected to the main network through a relay chain.

Relay Chain: The central chain in the Polkadot network that coordinates communication and consensus between different parachains.
