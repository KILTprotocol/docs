title: Sync Blockchain State
---

Before a collator can author blocks, the node needs to fully sync up with both the parachain and the relaychain.
Depending on the size of the blockchain states, it may take a number of hours to few days for the node to catch up.
More details can be found on the [Polkadot network docs](https://wiki.polkadot.network/docs/maintain-guides-how-to-validate-kusama#synchronize-chain-data).
