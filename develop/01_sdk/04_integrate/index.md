Integrating with KILT is easy.
If your project needs to integrate KILT in a frontend and/or a backend application, we've got you covered!

These pages are dedicated to helping you set up a [NodeJS application](./01_nodejs.md) or [web app](./02_browser.md).

We also introduce the [KILT distillery CLI tool](./03_distillery.md) which helps you quickly spin up your first KILT-based project.
