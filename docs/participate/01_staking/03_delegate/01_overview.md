In the [KILT **L**imited **D**elegated **P**roof **o**f **S**take (LDPoS)](https://medium.com/kilt-protocol/the-continuing-evolution-of-kilt-protocol-limited-delegated-proof-of-stake-640403427c48) consensus, Delegators play an important role (at least in the infancy of the network) to filter the pool of candidates for honest, trusted and well-performing Collators.

The requirements to become a Delegator are much more lightweight than [those for collators](../01_become_a_collator/01_overview.md).
You only need to stake a relatively lower number of tokens and decide on a Collator candidate.
Once the Collator on which you put your stake on, authors a block and thus receives a reward, you and all the other Delegators of this Collator also receive a reward.

The following sections will guide you through the process of becoming a Delegator, adjusting your stake, revoking a delegation and unstaking your tokens.

:::info
The amount of Delegators per Collator is limited and each Delegator can only stake to one Collator.
The latter is planned to be increased at a later stage.
