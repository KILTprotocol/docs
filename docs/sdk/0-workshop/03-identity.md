Let's create the <span class="label-role claimer">claimer</span> identity and the <span class="label-role attester">attester</span> identity. You'll see that the <span class="label-role verifier">verifier</span> identity won't be needed.

In KILT, an identity is an object that represents an entity - for example a person, an organization or even a machine.

An identity contains multiple properties.  
One of them is the `address` : it's the entity's unique and public identifier.


:::info KILT Identity

A KILT identity is a set of cryptographic elements:

- A keypair that is used to sign claims
- The address, which is generated from the public key
- An encryption keypair, used to encrypt messages between participants of the system

:::

All we need to create an identity is a mnemonic.

:::info mnemonic

In cryptography, a mnemonic usually consists of 12 or 24 random series of words. For example, `gold upset segment cake universe` is a mnemonic. It's used to generate keypairs. What's great about a mnemonic is that it's **human-readable**. A person can memorize it, and use it later to re-generate their keypairs and address.

:::

## Create a file

Create a new file `identity.js`.
All of the code for this step needs to go into this file.

## Code

To generate an identity, two methods from the KILT SDK are needed:

- `generateMnemonic()`
- `buildFromMnemonic(mnemonic)` // takes a mnemonic as an input, and outputs an `Identity` instance.

Open `identity.js` and paste the following code:

<CodeBlock className="language-ts">
  {Example1}
</CodeBlock>

You're now ready to generate an identity.

## Run

To generate an identity, run this command in your terminal, still within your `kilt-rocks` directory:

```bash
node identity.js
```

Your output should look like this (but it won't be identical since the mnemonic is randomly generated):

```bash
Mnemonic: gold upset segment cake universe carry demand comfort dawn invite element capital
Address: 5CUoo2vAegeaZHPNdxZyuMesR3RWYBKHj4jfVyj4FXzpXPuR
```

You want to run this command twice, in order to generate 2 identities: the <span class="label-role attester">attester</span>'s and the <span class="label-role claimer">claimer</span>'s. Hence, replace the content of `identity.js` with the following code:


<CodeBlock className="language-ts">
  {Example2}
</CodeBlock>

Copy and paste the two mnemonics and addresses somewhere, you'll need them soon.

In the next steps, we'll refer to the so-generated identities as follows:

- `<claimerMnemonic>` is the mnemonic for the claimer and `<claimerAddress>` the claimer's associated address;
- `<attesterMnemonic>` is the mnemonic for the attester and `<attesterAddress>` the attester's associated address.

That's it - You've successfully generated two new identities and their associated addresses!
