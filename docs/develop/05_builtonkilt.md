This section contains a non-exhaustive list of apps, wallets and websites that are built on KILT.
If you are not on the list and want to be added, you are welcome to [open a PR](https://github.com/KILTprotocol/docs/edit/master/docs/develop/05_builtonkilt.md).

## Wallets

Wallets are the gateway to Web3.
They store private information like secret keys for KILT DIDs and credentials.
Each time a website needs to access some information about the visitor, the wallet first asks its owner’s permission to share the requested information.

    Sporran is the first wallet to support the KILT protocol.
    It is maintained by _KILT Foundation_ and it is [open source](https://github.com/KILT-Foundation/sporran-extension).

## Web Apps

Decentralized applications have already been built that use the functions of the wallet.
