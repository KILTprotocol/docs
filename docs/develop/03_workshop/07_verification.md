In this section, you'll play the role of a <span className="label-role verifier">Verifier</span>:

- You'll take an `Presentation` object given to you by a <span className="label-role claimer">Claimer</span>;
- You'll verify that its data is correct;
- You'll verify that the attestation is valid, i.e., its hash exists on-chain and the attestation has not been revoked.
- You'll verify that the `Credential` is owned by the <span className="label-role claimer">Claimer</span> sending it

:::info Credential

A `Credential` object is also called an Attested Claim: it is what <span className="label-role claimer">claimers</span> need to create `Presentations`.

:::

:::info Presentation

A Credential is used to create the `Presentation` object by the <span className="label-role claimer">claimer</span>.
Unlike the Credential, a `Presentation` can hide some attributes that are not required by the <span className="label-role verifier">verifiers</span>.
A `Presentation` also contains a proof that the <span className="label-role claimer">claimer</span> owns the Credential.

## Create Presentation

It's not enough to just send our Credential as a <span className="label-role claimer">Claimer</span> as we also need to prove our ownership.
This is done by creating a presentation and signing the <span className="label-role verifier">Verifier</span>'s challenge.

Create `claimer/createPresentation.ts` helper and copy the following code.

<CodeBlock className="language-ts" title="claimer/createPresentation.ts">
  {CreatePresentation}
</CodeBlock>

## Verify

Let's create our `verify.ts`.
Here we'll expose `getChallenge` which returns a random and unique
challenge for the <span className="label-role claimer">Claimer</span> to sign, this is used to prove ownership.
We'll also expose `verifyCredential` which will do the actual verification.
Copy the code below, this completes the <span className="label-role verifier">Verifier</span> code!

<CodeBlock className="language-ts" title="verify.ts">
  {Verify}
</CodeBlock>

## Run

run the verification flow on command line:

```bash
yarn ts-node verify.ts
```

That's it! all done :-)
