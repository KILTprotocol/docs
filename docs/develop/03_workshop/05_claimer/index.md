This section covers the steps undertaken by the <span className="label-role claimer">Claimer</span>.

Here's an overview:

1. [Create a DID](./01_did.md), which is the identity used to interact with <span className="label-role attester">Attesters</span> and <span className="label-role verifier">Verifiers</span>.
2. Create a claim, request an attestation, and generate a credential using the attestation for our claim.
3. Present the claim to a <span className="label-role verifier">Verifier</span>.

## What is a Claimer?

Claimers are a crucial part of the Self-Sovereign Identity system.

A Claimer is an individual or institution that makes a claim or statement about their identity or abilities.
They can use their identity credentials to prove these claims, and third-party institutions verify them.

Anyone can be a Claimer.
All you need to do is complete a CType and create a claim.
Then, you can send these claims to Attesters for verification.

They store their identity credentials in their digital wallets, so they decide which information to provide to which service.
They have full control over their data and decide which data to share, where, and how.

You don't need to create a DID on the chain, meaning you are entirely independent!

Claimers can use their accounts without needing a chain connection.
