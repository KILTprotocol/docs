# Getting Started

The following guide will give you a started point to begin with KILT. 
What will you be able to do after this guide:

1. Import the **KILT SDK** into a project
2. Connect to the **KILT blockchain**
3. Query a **web3name** to get a **DID**
4. Verify a **credential**, fetched from **DID service endpoints**

After completing the getting started, you should have learn a little about KILT and a guide to learn by doing.
The guide requires some experience with javascript and command-line tools.
We will have recommended guides to other tutorials for further learnings.

We have a complete copy of the script here, in case you get stuck. **Add link**

**NOTE: Code will be written and then added to the testing later. To be DELETED afterwards**

## Setup

We will focus on creating a new project from stratch, which will require a little setup.
First, we need to create a new project in a new directory. For this, we run `mkdir kilt-rocks && cd kilt-rocks`.

From inside the `kilt-rocks` project directory, install the **SDK** and **typescript** with either of the following package managers:

```bash
npm install @kiltprotocol/sdk-js ts-node typescript
```

Or with `yarn`:

```bash
yarn add @kiltprotocol/sdk-js ts-node typescript
```

After you have imported the SDK, you are now able to access the functionality of KILT.
With all the required dependencies set, just create a new (empty) TS script file with `touch getting-started.ts`.

Lets first create an asynchronous function called `main` in order to excute the script.
Underneath the first line add the following:

``` js
async function main() {
    console.log('hello world')
}

main()
```

If the setup is correct you can excute the script by calling the name of the file using node.

``` bash
yarn ts-node getting-started.ts
```

You can always excute this file with the command.
It will refer to this command when requested to excute.

**Let's get started ðŸ”¥.**

### Importing KILT's SDK into a project

Lets begin by importing the SDK into the `getting-started.ts` add the following line to import the SDK.

``` js
import * as Kilt from '@kiltprotocol/sdk-js'
```

Now you are able to access the SDK and all its functionality.
We will move onto connecting to the **KILT blockchain**.

### Connecting to KILT blockchain

Connecting and disconnecting to the KILT is an important step requiring a setup of the configurations.
The connection allows to **query**, **verify** and **interact** with the chain.

**Lets get connected.**

Inside the `getting-started.ts` inside the `main` function, you will need to begin by connecting to a **KILT node**.
Using the imported SDK, it exposes **`Kilt.init()`** to initalise the connection to the KILT blockchain via an address.

We will initalise the **KILT blockchain** named the **Spiritnet**.  

``` js
async function main() {
...
    await Kilt.init({address: 'wss://spiritnet.kilt.io/'})
...
}
```

Now you have initalised the connection, lets connect to the chain.
Inside the `main` function, lets get the conncetion using an asynchronous call that creates a connection, or checks if an existing connection is available and connects directly.

``` js
...
    await Kilt.init({address: 'wss://spiritnet.kilt.io/'})
    
    await Kilt.ChainHelpers.BlockchainApiConnection.getConnectionOrConnect()
...
```

Now you have connected you have access to the chain, but lets not forget to close any connections.
Its best practice not to leave an connections open.
At the bottom of the `main` function, add the following function.

``` js
...
    await Kilt.disconnect()
    return
...
```

The `Kilt.disconncet()` will close any established connections.

**Congratulations!
You have done connected, lets start querying and fetching data from the chain!**

## Lets query the chain

Now you have a connection to the chain, you are able to query a variety of information using the exposed KILT functionality from the SDK.
We will be looking at the **web3names** (`john_doe`) and using them to fetch the corresponding **DID identifier**.
Underneath the blockchain connection, add the following lines.

``` js
...
    await Kilt.ChainHelpers.BlockchainApiConnection.getConnectionOrConnect()

    const johnDoeDidId = await Kilt.Did.Web3Names.queryDidForWeb3Name('john_doe')
    
    console.log(`Hello world, my name is john_doe and this is my DID ${johnDoeDidId}`)
...
```

Nice work! You have `john_doe`'s DID.
Now Let's see if they have any credentials availale to verify!

## Verifying a credential

**DIDs** are great tools for identification, you are able to have service endpoints on the DID.
Therefore, you can take your credentials and display them for others to see!
The usecases are almost endless when you have access to a credential or see a credential.
Lets see how we can check a **DIDs endpoints** and see if `john_doe` has any public credentials for us to **query** and **verify**.

Lets take the DID that was fetch and see if we can retreives the contents.
We will add a new line under the `console.log` and lets resolve the DID with the **DID identifier** fetched with the **web3name**.

``` js
...
    console.log(`Hello world, my name is john_doe and this is my DID ${johnDoeDidId}`)
    
    if (!johnDoeDidId) return 
    const johnDoeDid = await Kilt.Did.DidResolver.resolveDoc(johnDoeDidId)
    const endPoints = johnDoeDid?.details?.getEndpoints()
...
```

Now we have the endpoints! Lets see if we can find a credential among them.
We can select one of the endpoints and query the url to see if it returns a credential!

A new line after `endPoints` add the following:

``` js
...
    const endPoints = johnDoeDid?.details?.getEndpoints()

    console.log(`John Doe first endpoint: ${endpoints[0].url}`)

    fetch()
...
```
