The bounty program is a system in which individuals can earn rewards by completing specific tasks related to the KILT Protocol. Bounties can cover a wide range of activities that are relevant to the development and improvement of the KILT Protocol. Here are some examples of the types of tasks that might be included in the bounty program:

- Fixing a bug or vulnerability: This could involve identifying and resolving a security issue in the KILT codebase or one of its associated projects.

- Developing a strategy: This could involve creating a plan or proposal for how to improve some aspect of the KILT Protocol, such as governance, DID implementations, network scalability, or developer tools.

- Monitoring tasks related to a specific topic: This could involve tracking and reporting on a specific set of metrics related to the performance or health of the KILT network, or providing ongoing support and guidance to community members working on related projects.

Other examples of bounty tasks might include creating new documentation or educational resources for developers, contributing to the development of new features or tools for the KILT Protocol, or providing support and guidance to community members who are new to the platform. The goal of the bounty program is to incentivize individuals with relevant skills and expertise to focus on tasks that are important for the overall success of the KILT Protocol, and to reward them for their contributions.

The list of available bounties can be found in the [KILT Protocol github](https://github.com/KILTprotocol). The KILT Protocol  Core team creates the tasks for the bounty program and adds them to the github [bounty board](https://github.com/orgs/KILTprotocol/projects/27/views/1) and the discussions area for [polkassembly](https://kilt.polkassembly.io/discussions), which is a community forum for discussing KILT Protocol governance and proposals. The bounties in the discussion forum will include the prefix 'Bounty:' then the title of the ticket in github. It will include the github ticket.

To earn a reward for completing a bounty, the task must be submitted to the blockchain. It will have to be reviewed by the KILT Protocol Core team. This typically involves providing evidence that the task has been completed, such as code changes or a report on the task outcome. The amount of the reward varies depending on the specific bounty and the difficulty or importance of the task. The KILT Protocol Core team will approve the bounty and will be paid out after reviewed.

Overall, the bounty program provides a decentralised way for individuals to contribute to the development and improvement of the KILT Protocol while also earning rewards for their efforts. It also helps to incentivize individuals with relevant skills and expertise to focus on tasks that are important for the overall success of the protocol.

## Submitting a Bounty for Reward

To work on a bounty, the individual would have first identified a task that they are interested in and have the relevant skills to complete. They would then have reviewed the details of the bounty, including the reward amount, submission requirements, and any specific guidelines or instructions provided by the KILT Core team.

After completing the task, the individual would have submitted their work to the KILT Core team for review. This typically involves providing evidence that the task has been completed, such as code changes, test results, or a report on the task outcome. The KILT Core team would then review the submission and determine whether it meets the criteria for the bounty.

If the submission is approved, the individual would receive the reward of KILT coins specified for the bounty. If the submission is not approved, the KILT Core team may provide feedback on what needs to be improved or suggest additional changes that need to be made before resubmitting.

Overall, working on a bounty involves identifying tasks that align with the individual's skills and interests, completing the task to the best of their ability, and submitting the work for review to receive the reward if the submission is approved.
