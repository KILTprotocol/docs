title: Request an Attestation

import CodeBlock from '@theme/CodeBlock';
import SnippetBlock from '../../../../src/components/SnippetBlock';
import CreateClaim from '!!raw-loader!../../../../code-examples/workshop/claimer/createClaim.js';
import CreateRequest from '!!raw-loader!../../../../code-examples/workshop/claimer/createRequest.js';

In this section we'll create a `Claim` and request a `RequestForAttestation`.
But a claim in itself has no value. To become valid in the eyes of <span class="label-role verifier">Verifiers</span>,
it needs to be attested by an entity they can trust: an <span class="label-role attester">Attester</span>.

:::info

 KILT is an open system.
 Anyone/anything can make a claim about themselves and attest this claim. But a claim only has value if the verifier _trusts_ the attester.

## Create Claim

We'll use provided `light DID`, `ctype` and <span class="label-role claimer">Claimer</span> provided `content` to generate the `Claim` object. Create a file `claimer/createClaim.js` and copy the code below.

<CodeBlock className="language-js" title="claimer/createClaim.js">
  {CreateClaim}
</CodeBlock>

## Create Request

We don't want to send our `Claim` object plainly over the internet. Instead
we'll form a `RequestForAttestation` object that we can send to the <span class="label-role attester">Attester</span>.
Create a file `claimer/createRequest.js` and copy the code below.

<CodeBlock className="language-js" title="claimer/createRequest.js">
  {CreateRequest}
</CodeBlock>

When `Attestations` are given by <span class="label-role attester">Attesters</span>, they are written to chain which requires a deposit. Each new `RequestForAttestation` is unique. While we're testing, we can store and reuse requests to avoid to avoid
multiple attestations. To do this store the output into `./claimer/_request.json`. You can also share this
request to others in the workshop to see how they get denied from fraudulent senders.

## Claimer Index

Ok, let's continue our `claimer/index.js`. This will serve to export to convenience functions.
First we'll import our helper functions we made above, then export `createClaim` and `createRequest`.

<SnippetBlock
  title="claimer/index.js"
  className="language-js"
  snippets='[
    [0, 19],
    [20,56],
    "}"
  ]'
>
  {ClaimerIndex}
</SnippetBlock>

## Index

Alright update our `index.js`, we'll run it from there.

<SnippetBlock
  title="index.js"
  className="language-js"
  snippets='[
    [0, 13],
    [14,32],
    [48,54]
  ]'
>
  {Index}
</SnippetBlock>

run it from command line

```bash
node index.js
```

OK, you've made a claim as a <span class="label-role claimer">Claimer</span> and
created a request for attestation. Let's finish up our <span class="label-role attester">Attester</span> and get a credential!
