A claim type (CType) is a KILT-specific term, but the concept is simple:
A CType is a JSON schema that defines the structure of a claim, and you can think of it as the data model for your claim.

:::info CType

A CType ensures that a credential contains all required attributes, e.g., a driver's license has to contain a name, date of birth, and the vehicle types that the claimer can drive.
The CType is important since a Verifier requests credentials for a specific CType.
For example, the traffic police want to see your driver's license, not your gym membership.

To learn more about CTypes, read the [in-depth CType documentation](../../../concepts/05_credentials/02_ctypes.md).
You can also [read through existing CTypes in the CType-index](https://github.com/KILTprotocol/ctype-index).
:::

Before the <span className="label-role attester">Attester</span> can attest credentials, they must decide which CType they support.
For example, a traffic authority only issues driver's licenses (A CType for driver's license), not a university diploma.

Since CTypes enable interoperability between Attesters, using existing CTypes rather than creating new ones is highly recommended.
However, this workshop creates a new CType to show the process.

Creating CTypes requires an account and a full DID.
Make sure your account holds KILT tokens so that you can pay the fees for creating a CType.

For example, a basic CType for a driver's license could look like this:

<CodeBlock className="language-json">
  {Ctype}
</CodeBlock>

The CType has the following attributes:

| Key          | Value                                                                                                                                                               |
| -------------| ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `$id`        | The KILT id of this CType. It's the most important property as it represents the **digital footprint** of the CType.                                               |
| `$schema`    | A reference to the meta-schema describing what a CType may look like. There are two versions.                                                              |
| `title`      | The title of the CType.                                                                                                                                             |
| `properties` | The properties that a claim conforming to this CType may have.                                                                                                      |
| `type` | Type is an object for all CTypes.                                                                                                  |
| `additionalProperties` | The default is false. This restricts unwanted properties in a claim.                                                                                                      |

A CType is stored on the KILT blockchain.

In a real-world situation, a user would retrieve an existing CType from the chain or a CType registry.
For example, via a Credential Registry's REST API.

In this tutorial, the <span className="label-role attester">Attester</span> creates and attempts to store a CType on the KILT test blockchain.

## Create CType

Copy the following to define a `CType` with a given schema:

<TsJsBlock fileName="attester/ctypeSchema">
  {CtypeSchema}
</TsJsBlock>

:::warning

As many people follow this workshop, using the CType schema defined above will result in a duplicate error when you run the code later.
To avoid this, change the value of `fromProperties` to something unique, such as adding your name to the "Drivers License" string.

:::

## Get CType

Copy the following to create a `CType` on the chain:

<TsJsBlock fileName="attester/generateCtype">
  {GenerateCtype}
</TsJsBlock>

The `ensureStoredCType` function takes the Attester's account, DID, and a callback to sign the function and checks if the CType is already on chain.
It uses the `verifyStored` method to pass the CType to the KILT blockchain and make the check.
If it does not exist, it stores it on chain, using the `toChain` method to encode the CType into a unique hash and the `add` method to create a new CType from the given unique hash and associate it with the Attester.
The function then uses the `authorizeTx` to authorize the transaction and `signAndSubmitTx` to sign and submit the transaction containing the new CType.

:::warning

Remember, an account must have the required amount of tokens to pay the transaction fee and deposit.

## Run

<Tabs groupId="ts-js-choice">
  <TabItem value='ts' label='Typescript' default>

  Run the `attester/generateCtype.ts` file.

  ```bash
  yarn ts-node attester/generateCtype.ts
  ```

  </TabItem>
  <TabItem value='js' label='Javascript' default>

  Run the `attester/generateCtype.js` file.

  ```bash
  node attester/generateCtype.js
  ```

  </TabItem>
</Tabs>

Before you can attest Credentials, you need a <span className="label-role claimer">Claimer</span> to request it
