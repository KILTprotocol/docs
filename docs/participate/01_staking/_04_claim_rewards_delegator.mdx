### Prepare claiming

First, you need to convert your _reward points_ into balance.

1. Select the delegator account for which you want to claim the rewards. It should have enough balance to cover the transaction fee which is around 0.005 KILT (the *using the selected account* field)
2. Select the appropriate extrinsic: `parachainStaking -> incrementDelegatorRewards()`
3. Sign and submit the extrinsic (the *Submit Transaction* button)
