This section details the various tools and apps that can be used to interact with the KILT chain.

* [The Parity Signer](./01-parity-signer.md) can be used to create offline transactions. It is currently not recommended to use the app for using functionality like attesting and revoking claims.
* The [Polkadot Apps](https://polkadot.js.org/apps/?rpc=wss%3A%2F%2Fspiritnet.api.onfinality.io%2Fpublic-ws#/explorer) can be used to interact with the KILT chain on a very low level and targets experienced users.
