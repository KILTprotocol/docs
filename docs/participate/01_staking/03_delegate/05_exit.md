title: Leave the Set of Delegators
---

import StakingTxDisclaimer from '../_disclaimer_staking_tx.md';

A Delegator can revoke all of their delegations at once by calling `parachainStaking -> leaveDelegators`.
- Your previously delegated amount will be prepared for unstaking.
- You need to wait 7 days (in block time) before you can unlock your unstaked tokens, see the section [Unlock Unstaked](../04_unlock_unstaked.md) for more information.
- Exiting does not count towards the limit of “1 delegation per round”.

1. Select the Delegator's KILT address as the extrinsic submitter (the *using the selected account* field)
2. Select the appropriate extrinsic: `parachainStaking -> leaveDelegators`.
3. Sign and submit the extrinsic (the *Submit Transaction* button)

:::info
Since you can only delegate to a single Collator candidate for now, exiting is exactly the same as [**revoking a single delegation**](./04_revoke.md).
Of course, this will change if the community decides to enable multiple delegations per account.
