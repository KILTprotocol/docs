In this tutorial, we'll run through the full story of a claim.

To do so, three actors will be involved: a <span class="label-role claimer">Claimer</span>, an <span class="label-role attester">Attester</span> and a <span class="label-role verifier">Verifier</span>.
You'll be playing all three roles. In the real world, these actors would be running different services, so we set up different folders to mimic this separation.

Both the <span class="label-role verifier">Verifier</span> and the <span class="label-role attester">Attester</span> have to interact with the KILT blockchain.
But only the <span class="label-role attester">Attester</span> is required to own KILTs since he has to pay for storing attestation on chain.
The <span class="label-role verifier">Verifier</span> only needs to query the KILT blockchain to ensure that the attestation is still valid and wasn't revoked.
The <span class="label-role claimer">Claimer</span> is not required to query the blockchain, but he might do so to check whether their credential is still valid or the attester has revoked it.

## Request an Attestation

Before the <span class="label-role claimer">Claimer</span> can receive an attestation, he needs to generate a LightDID, which he can do completely off-chain.
The <span class="label-role attester">Attester</span> has to register their DID on chain and therefore needs KILT coins.

After <span class="label-role attester">Attester</span> and <span class="label-role claimer">Claimer</span> have setup their identities the claimer can start the attestation process by requesting an attestation from the <span class="label-role attester">Attester</span>.

    A->>+B: Store attestation
    B-->>-A: Attestation hash
    A-->>-C: Attestation Hash
    C->>C: Build Credential
```

## Verify an Attestation

The <span class="label-role verifier">Verifier</span> request a presentation for the claimer for a specific CType.
It's important to require a specific CType since that's what gives the presentation meaning.
We will [explain CType in more detail](attester/ctype) in a later chapter.
A presentation is derived from a credential and doesn't need to contain all attributes.
A <span class="label-role claimer">Claimer</span> could choose to hide their address from their Passport if the <span class="label-role verifier">Verifier</span> only is interested in their age.

    C-->>-V: submit presentation
    V->>B: check validity of presentation
```
