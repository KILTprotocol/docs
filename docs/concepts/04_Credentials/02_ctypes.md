CTypes are data types specific to KILT that define the structure of a claim (i.e. the data model for your claim).
They are based on JSON Schema, a standard used to annotate and validate JSON documents.
The schema defines which properties exist and what their type should be, e.g., a string, a number, an object, etc.

## JSON-Schema

KILT uses [JSON-Schema](https://json-schema.org/) (currently draft-07) to validate and annotate data in a strict format.
This data format for [CType models](https://github.com/KILTprotocol/sdk-js/blob/develop/packages/core/src/ctype/CTypeSchema.ts) forms a CType with the definition of its characteristics.
The following are all required properties of the schema, with no additional properties allowed:

- Identifier: `$id` in the format `kilt:ctype:0x{cTypeHash}`
- KILT specific JSON-Schema: '[http://kilt-protocol.org/draft-01/ctype-input#](http://kilt-protocol.org/draft-01/ctype-input#)'
- Title: Defines a user-friendly name for the CType that makes it easier for users to contextualise
- Properties: Each property is the attribute the claimer wishes to have attested by the attester.

### Properties

When making a new CType schema, the following properties are required:

- One of the following fields: `type` or `$ref`
- A type of 'string', 'integer', 'number' and 'boolean' to define the attribute
- Nested JSON schemas can be referenced by a `uri` using `$ref`(giving the advantage of being able to reference other CTypes)
- The format field is optionally:
  - Date format e.g. 2012-04-23T18:25:43.511Z
  - Time format e.g. T18:25:43.511Z
  - URI format e.g. https://www.example.com

```js title="CType schema example"
{
  $id: 'kilt:ctype:0xda3861a45e0197f3ca145c2c209f9126e5053fas503e459af4255cf8011d51010',
  $schema: 'http://kilt-protocol.org/draft-01/ctype#',
  title: 'CtypeModel 2',
  properties: {
    name: { type: 'string' },
    age: { $ref: `kilt:ctype:0x01`, },
    },
  type: 'object',
}
```

The CType schema is afterwards wrapped into the full CType object:

```js title="CType example"
{
  schema:  {...} // as defined in the example above,
  owner: null, // DID of the owner, or null
  hash: '0xda3861a45e0197f3ca145c2c209f9126e5053fas503e459af4255cf8011d51010' // For looking up on-chain
}
```

## CType Metadata

CType Metadata can be linked to a given CType to provide title and descriptions in different languages for the whole CType and its properties.

## Hashing

The hash of the CType is used to identify and anchor it to the chain.
This `hash` is stored on-chain via the store method.

### Constructing the `hash` for the `$id`

KILT uses the hashing algorithm blake2b, hashing the CType contents.
The object is sorted by a canonicalization algorithm before hashing to ensure that semantically equivalent CTypes with different order of their properties would produce the same output hash.

The `hash` is made from the following fields in the schema object:

- `$schema`
- `properties`
  - `key`
  - `$ref`
  - `type`
  - `format`
- `title`
- `type`

The `$id` property, if present, is excluded from the hashing process since it represents the result of such a process.

The `$id` is generated, by prepending the hash (in hex form) with `kilt:ctype`.
A typical CType id would look like this: `kilt:ctype:0xba15bf4960766b0a6ad7613aa3338edce95df6b22ed29dd72f6e72d740829b84`

## Storing / Querying CTypes

CTypes can be stored on the blockchain.
After creating a CType, the `store` transaction will include the full CType as a remark and will anchor the hash of it on the chain.
Querying is not trivial, since the transaction would have to be found in the blockchain history, but it can be retrieved from indexing services.

## Exchange of CTypes with different actors

There are three actors in the KILT workflow: Claimers (the holder of the credential), Attesters (who do the work and approve or reject the credential) and Verifiers (who require a credential from a Claimer).

A Claimer can apply for a new credential by requesting a CType from the Attester.
The Claimer then creates a Claim, based on the CType and sends the information to be attested to the Attester.
The Attester confirms the information and returns a credential.

A Verifier can request a credential from a Claimer that follows a given CType.
For example, a gaming company may request a specific credential to verify the gamer's ranking.
Depending on how this credential was created initially, this can be done with the software development kit (SDK) messaging, or in other ways independent of the protocol (e.g., via browser extensions, email, QR code, etc.)

Each actor in the system can verify the ownership and validity of the given CType at any time.
