In the [KILT **L**imited **D**elegated **P**roof **o**f **S**take (LDPoS)](https://medium.com/kilt-protocol/the-continuing-evolution-of-kilt-protocol-limited-delegated-proof-of-stake-640403427c48) consensus, delegators play an important role (at least in the infancy of the network) to filter the pool of candidates for honest, trusted and well-performing collators.

The requirements to become a delegator are much less than [those for collators](../01_become_a_collator/01_overview.md).
You only need to stake a relatively low number of tokens and decide on a collator candidate.
Once the collator you have backed with your stake authors a block and thus receives a reward, you and all the other delegators of this collator also receive a reward.

The following sections will guide you through the process of becoming a delegator, adjusting your stake, revoking a delegation and unstaking your tokens.

:::info
The amount of delegators per collator is limited.
Currently, each delegator can only stake to one collator per account; this may change if the community decides to enable multiple delegations per account.
