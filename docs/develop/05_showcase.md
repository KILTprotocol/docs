This section contains a non-exhaustive list of apps, wallets and websites that integrate KILT.
If you are missing from the list and want to be added, you are welcome to [open a PR](https://github.com/KILTprotocol/docs/edit/develop/docs/develop/showcase.md).

## Wallets

Wallets are the swiss army knife of the Web3.
They store private information like secret keys for KILT DIDs and Credentials.
Each time a website needs to access some information about the visitor, wallets ask for user's permission to share the requested information.

    Sporran is the first wallet with KILT support.
    It is maintained by _BOTLabs Trusted Entity B.T.E GmbH_ and it is [open source](https://github.com/BTE-Trusted-Entity/sporran-extension).

## Apps

One does not have to use their swiss army knife exclusively on raw materials.
Luckily, some applications have also built on KILT.
