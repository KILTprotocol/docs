import Tabs from '@theme/Tabs';

## Node.js

You need to have [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/) installed.
Any stable (LTS >= 14.0) version is sufficient.

## Dependencies

Navigate into your newly created folder `kilt-rocks`, initialize the project and install dependencies.<br/>
- [KILT SDK-JS](https://github.com/KILTprotocol/sdk-js#readme) - for KILT functionality
- [PolkadotJS Crypto-Utils](https://github.com/polkadot-js/common/tree/master/packages/util-crypto#readme) - for a few crypto utilities
- [dotenv](https://github.com/motdotla/dotenv#readme) - to help us load variables from `.env`

<!-- When updating this version also update 00-welcome.md! -->
```bash npm2yarn
npm init -y
npm install @kiltprotocol/sdk-js@0.25.3 @polkadot/util-crypto@8.3.3 dotenv
```

Make sure to add `"type": "module"` to the `package.json` since this workshop uses ES6 Modules.

## Project Folder

The project structure looks like the following:

```bash
â””â”€ kilt-rocks/ # project
    â”œâ”€ attester/ # all attester code
    â”œâ”€ claimer/ # all claimer code
    â”œâ”€ verify.js # all verifier code
    â”œâ”€ .env # environment variables
    â”œâ”€ package.json # the project file
    â””â”€ yarn.lock # dependency lock file
```

You can setup the directories now or later when we need them.

## PILT Tokens

In this workshop you will interact with the Peregrine blockchain.
You are required to pay for each transaction with PILT coins.
But worry not!
PILT coins don't have any value and can be requested from the [faucet](https://faucet.peregrine.kilt.io).


## Blockchain Connection

Before you call any SDK functionality, you need to initialise the crypto libraries and configure the SDK.
For this workshop we'll be using [Peregrine Staging Testnet](https://polkadot.js.org/apps/?rpc=wss%3A%2F%2Fperegrine-stg.kilt.io%2Fpara-public-ws#/explorer).
This is done calling `await Kilt.init({ address })` where `address` is the address of the full node you want to connect to.
For this workshop use `wss://peregrine.kilt.io/parachain-public-ws`.
Add the address to your `.env` file.

```env title=".env"
WSS_ADDRESS=wss://peregrine.kilt.io/parachain-public-ws
```

That's it for the basic setup - We're good to go!
