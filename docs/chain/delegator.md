## How to join

**Important: A candidate can only delegate `(join_delegators, delegate_another_candidate)` once per round!**

Anyone can delegate to a collator candidate by delegating at least 20 KILT and calling `join_delegators`.

If the collator has a delegation pool reaching the maximum (30 at the time of writing), a delegator candidate must stake more than the lowest delegator.

- The kicked delegator will be replaced by the delegator with a higher delegation immediately.
- The kicked delegator's stake is prepared for unstaking as if they revoked the delegation (*see [revoking](#Revoking)*).
- A delegator needs to wait 7 days to be able to unlock the stake.

**An account can only delegate to one collator!**

## How to adjust your stake

A delegator can increase and decrease the stake by calling either  `delegator_stake_more` or `delegator_stake_less`.

**The candidate can not increase or decrease stake if leaving!**

`Developer -> Extrinsics -> parachainStaking`

1. Use the selected account: Select the Delegator Account.
2. Submit the following extrinsic: parachainStaking -> `delegator_stake_more` or `delegator_stake_less`.
3. Select the collator account: Choose the desired stake amount.

## How to revoke your stake

A delegator revokes their delegation by calling `revoke_delegation`, reducing the delegation by the full amount of the delegation.

- The corresponding amount will be prepared for unstaking.
- Revoking a delegation does not count towards the limit of “1 delegation per round”.

## How to exit

An account can revoke all delegations at once by calling `leave_delegators`.

Once a collator candidate exits by calling `execute_leave_candidates`, all of their delegations are automatically removed and the corresponding amounts are prepared for unstaking.

## How to unlock unstaked tokens

A revoking delegation has to wait 7 days before unlocking the staked amount back by executing `unlock_unstaked`.

## Lifecycle of a Delegator

The following diagram depicts the lifecycle of a delegator from owning free KILT to delegating, losing a delegation seat, re-delegating and finally unlocking their stake.
