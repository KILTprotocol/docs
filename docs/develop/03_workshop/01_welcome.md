## Welcome, curious mind!

In this tutorial, you will:

✔ Get familiar with the essential concepts in KILT: accounts, DIDs, CTypes, claims, credentials, and more.

✔ Use the KILT SDK to implement the basic flow of a KILT claim, from creation until verification.
You'll create a claim as a <span className="label-role claimer">Claimer</span>, attest it as an <span className="label-role attester">Attester</span> and verify it as a <span className="label-role verifier">Verifier</span>.

✔ Use the KILT SDK to write onto and read from the KILT blockchain.
