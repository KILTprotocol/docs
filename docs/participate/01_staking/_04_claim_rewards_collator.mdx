### Prepare claiming

First, you need to convert your _reward points_ into balance.

1. Select the collator account for which you want to claim the rewards.
It should have enough balance to cover the transaction fee which is around 0.0001 KILT (the *using the selected account* field)
2. Select the appropriate extrinsic: `parachainStaking -> incrementCollatorRewards()`
3. Sign and submit the extrinsic (the *Submit Transaction* button)

### Claim

Finally, you can claim your well deserved staking rewards.

1. Select the collator account for which you want to claim the rewards.
It should have enough balance to cover the transaction fee which is around 0.0001 KILT (the *using the selected account* field)
2. Select the appropriate extrinsic: `parachainStaking -> claimRewards()`
3. Sign and submit the extrinsic (the *Submit Transaction* button)

### Recommendation: Batched call

We recommend to execute both extrinsics in a single batch to save on transaction fees:

1. Select the collator account for which you want to claim the rewards. 
It should have enough balance to cover the transaction fee which is around 0.000112 KILT (the *using the selected account* field)
2. Select the batch extrinsic: `utility -> batch()`
3. Select the reward increment extrinsic: `parachainStaking -> incrementCollatorRewards()`
4. Press the `+` button and add the reward claiming extrinsic: `parachainStaking -> claimRewards()`5
5. Sign and submit the extrinsic (the *Submit Transaction* button)
